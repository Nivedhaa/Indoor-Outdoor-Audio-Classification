# Indoor Outdoor Audio Classification

This repository contains the code for a machine learning pipeline that uses the MLEnd London Sounds dataset to predict whether a given audio segment was recorded indoors or outdoors.

## Project Overview
The project involves creating a machine learning pipeline that can accept an audio segment as input and predict the environment in which it was recorded - indoors or outdoors. This is done using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset, which provides a variety of audio segments each labeled as either recorded indoors or outdoors.
